# Car-Booking-System

## Description

An online platform known as a car booking system enables consumers to reserve and rent cars from car rental companies. Customers can use it to look up, compare, and reserve automobiles based on location, availability, and rental requirements. The method, which offers a quick and easy option to rent a car for specific days and times, has grown in popularity in recent years. The technology replaces the outdated process in which customers had to phone the car rental company to reserve a vehicle and travel to the car rental facility to pick up their vehicle.

A car rental booking system's main objective is to make it simple for consumers to look for and reserve a rental car from the convenience of their home or place of business. Small compact cars, bigger family cars, luxury cars, and even specialized vehicles like SUVs and minivans are all available through the system. Customers can choose the type of vehicle they need, define the dates and location of the rental, and make a secure payment during the quick and easy car reservation procedure.

One of the main advantages of using the system is the convenience that the system provides to customers. Customers are no longer required to go to a physical automobile rental office, wait in line, or get help. Instead, customers may find and reserve a rental automobile whenever they want, anywhere, using a computer, tablet, or smartphone. Those who need to make last-minute plans or who are pressed for time will find this convenience to be especially helpful.

Another advantage of a car booking system is the ability to compare prices and choose the best deal for a particular rental period. Customers can compare prices from a range of different car rental companies and choose the one that offers the best value for money. This helps customers to find the best rental car for their needs and budget, without having to spend hours searching for the right vehicle.

There are three types of users in the system: public, customer, and admin. The public can view the website's index page, but in order to book a car, they must first register as a customer. After that, they will be able to log into the system as a customer and begin making reservations by selecting the type of car, the date of the pickup, and the date of the return. The customer could edit the reservation's details to suit their needs if they wanted to. Customers may also choose to edit the information in their profiles. To make it easier for the customer to prepare for payment, the system will calculate the final cost.

The administrator monitors the car-booking process by reviewing each reservation that a customer has made. In order to confirm the reservation after the customer makes a booking, the admin must first approve or reject the request. In addition, the admin could add or modify vehicles and review all of the car inventories.
